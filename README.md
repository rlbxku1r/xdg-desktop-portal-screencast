# xdg-desktop-portal-screencast

This program provides a screencast portal support for the [Muffin](https://github.com/rlbxku1r/muffin/tree/screencast-workaround) compositor.  
The main purpose of this project is _to workaround_ the screencast functionally on the Wayland session, and
**it is not intended for general use or to be used as a permanent solution**.
